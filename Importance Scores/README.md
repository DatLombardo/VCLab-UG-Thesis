1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction
============

This repository includes all work completed during my Undergraduate
Honours Thesis completed from September 2018 to April 2019 in the
Visual Computing Lab (VCLab).

The next step of my thesis will be exploring using LSTM's with the help of
VGG16 feature extraction to see if an LSTM can rank the importance of a given
frame after viewing a sequence of previous frames.
